    "title": "US power prices spike as deep freeze hits data-centre corridor",
    "content": "Wholesale power prices surged in PJM’s Virginia zone as Winter Storm Fern drove demand above forecasts in a region packed with energy-hungry data centres. Reuters reported real-time prices topping $1,800/MWh in Dominion Energy’s territory, highlighting how extreme weather can rapidly reprice power and gas constraints risk spilling into broader energy markets.",
    "summary": "A US cold blast triggered a sharp spike in wholesale power prices, underscoring grid stress and energy-supply sensitivity.",
    "context": "• US electricity demand growth has been accelerated by data-centre build-outs linked to AI and cloud workloads.\n\n• Winter weather can tighten power markets quickly when fuel supply (especially natural gas) and transmission become constrained.\n\n• Grid operators have been focused on winter reliability since recent cold-weather stress events and record demand prints.",
    "happened": "• Reuters said real-time wholesale power prices topped $1,800/MWh in Dominion Energy’s Virginia territory, up from about $200/MWh the prior morning.\n\n• PJM data showed demand around 5% above the original forecast in Dominion’s zone as the storm spread.\n\n• PJM projected a potential winter demand record of 147.2 GW on Tuesday versus the prior record of 143.7 GW (January 2025).",
    "implications": "• Elevated spot power prices can pressure utilities and power retailers if hedges are insufficient.\n\n• Weather-driven price spikes can feed into natural gas demand and basis volatility where pipeline constraints bite.\n\n• The episode reinforces investor focus on grid capex, reliability upgrades, and the cost of serving data-centre load growth.",
    "importance": "• Power is increasingly a tradable macro input for AI-era growth themes and infrastructure bottlenecks.\n\n• Extreme-weather stress tests can shift expectations for utility earnings, regulatory scrutiny, and capacity pricing.\n\n• Volatility in power and gas markets can ripple into inflation sensitivity and broader risk sentiment when disruptions widen."

    "title": "Venezuela sends first direct crude cargo to US under new supply deal",
    "content": "A Trafigura-chartered tanker departed Venezuela for Louisiana’s LOOP, the first direct shipment to a US port under a 50-million-barrel supply deal agreed this month between Caracas and Washington, Reuters reported. The move signals a shift in sanctioned-oil flows and could affect heavy-sour crude availability and regional refinery economics.",
    "summary": "A first direct Venezuela-to-US crude cargo under a new deal highlights changing sanctioned supply routes and heavy crude dynamics.",
    "context": "• US refinery demand for heavy crude makes Venezuelan grades strategically relevant for Gulf Coast runs.\n\n• Sanctions/licensing decisions can quickly redirect barrels and reshape crude differentials and freight patterns.\n\n• Venezuela has been drawing down accumulated storage as exports restart under new permissions.",
    "happened": "• Reuters reported the Liberia-flagged Gloria Maris left Venezuela’s Jose port carrying about 1 million barrels of Merey heavy crude bound for Louisiana’s LOOP.\n\n• Vitol and Trafigura received the first US licences to load and export Venezuelan oil as part of the deal, Reuters said.\n\n• Reuters cited shipping data showing 10–11 million barrels shipped so far under the arrangement and noted preparations to begin exporting fuel oil as well.",
    "implications": "• More direct flows to the US could tighten or loosen heavy crude spreads depending on volumes and competing sources.\n\n• Shifts in freight routes (Caribbean storage versus direct delivery) can change tanker demand and time spreads.\n\n• The sustainability of these flows hinges on policy stability and operational constraints, including storage drawdowns and production decisions.",
    "importance": "• Heavy crude supply is a key driver of Gulf Coast refinery margins and product crack spreads.\n\n• Policy-driven supply changes can move crude benchmarks, differentials, and energy equities.\n\n• The story matters for traders positioned in heavy-sour grades, refined products, and energy shipping."

    "title": "Saudi equities climb as market prepares to open to all foreign investors",
    "content": "Saudi Arabia’s benchmark index rose as investors positioned for fourth-quarter earnings and ahead of a February 1 rule change opening the market to all categories of foreign investors, Reuters reported. The prospect of broader access could lift inflow expectations and affect regional EM equity allocations.",
    "summary": "Saudi stocks gained on earnings optimism and anticipation of a wider foreign-investor opening from 1 February.",
    "context": "• Regulatory liberalisation is a key catalyst for EM equity inflows and benchmark inclusion dynamics.\n\n• Gulf equity performance often co-moves with oil, bank earnings expectations, and geopolitical risk premia.\n\n• Foreign access changes can alter liquidity, valuation multiples, and sector leadership in domestic markets.",
    "happened": "• Reuters said Saudi’s benchmark index gained 1.2%, led by a 1.8% rise in Al Rajhi Bank.\n\n• Reuters reported the capital market will open to all foreign investors from February 1, easing rules to attract more overseas capital.\n\n• Reuters noted sentiment was also supported by expectations of upcoming earnings and a recent rebound in oil prices.",
    "implications": "• Broader foreign participation could increase turnover and deepen liquidity, potentially lowering the local risk premium.\n\n• Portfolio reallocations may favour large-cap banks and liquid names likely to attract international flows.\n\n• Regional markets may see relative-valuation repricing as investors compare access, governance and earnings momentum.",
    "importance": "• Market-access reforms can be a structural driver of sustained inflows rather than a one-off trading catalyst.\n\n• Saudi equities are a major EM allocation point, so rule changes can influence regional benchmarks and passive flows.\n\n• The story links oil, banks, and geopolitics—three of the biggest drivers of Gulf asset pricing."
